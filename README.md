## Author: Arshad Pathan

This project is an Arduino-based digital counter that utilizes interrupts to count digital events or pulses. It provides an efficient and accurate method for counting external signals without the need for continuous polling.

# Features
  - **Interrupt-based Counting:** The counter employs interrupts to detect and count digital events, ensuring precise and timely counting without blocking the Arduino's main loop.
  - **High Accuracy:** By utilizing interrupts, the counter eliminates the possibility of missed events, providing reliable and accurate counting.
  - **Multiple Event Sources:** It supports counting events from various digital sources such as sensors, switches, encoders, or any device that generates digital pulses.
  - **Flexible Event Triggering:** The counter can be configured to trigger on rising edges, falling edges, or both, depending on the specific requirements of your project.
  - **Easy Integration:** The project is designed to be easily integrated into existing Arduino projects. Simply connect the event source to the designated digital pin, and the counter will handle the rest.
  - **Clear and Extensible Code:** The code is well-documented and organized, making it easy to understand, modify, and extend to suit your specific needs.
  - **Example Sketches:** Included example sketches demonstrate how to use the counter with different event sources, allowing you to quickly get started and adapt it to your application.

# Getting Started
To get started with the Arduino Digital Interrupt Based Counter, follow these steps:

  1. Connect your event source (e.g., sensor, switch, encoder) to the desired digital pin D2 on the Arduino board.
  2. Download the counter code example sketche from the GitHub repository.
  3. Open the sketche into your Arduino IDE.
  4. Upload the sketch to your Arduino board.
  5. Monitor the counter output through the Arduino's serial monitor or integrate it into your project as needed.

For detailed instructions and usage examples, please refer to the project's documentation available in the repository.
